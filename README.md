“… We need serious Data Science help and we know you Hooomans are the best at it…. We are an
intergalactic species which have almost achieved singularity and the highest possible levels of
development. We travel fast through space and explore other galaxies”
“The only essence that we consume is energy, measured in DSML units…Our populace is
widespread and we live across many different star clusters and galaxies. What we need now is to
optimize our well-being across all those galaxies… We have a lot of data but our computers and methods
are too weak – we urgently need your data science knowledge to help us

In this case I should predict index values and allocated energy from a newly discovered star 
There are also several constraints:
• In total there are 50000 zillion DSML available for allocation and no galaxy at a point in time
• no galaxy should be allocated more than 100 zillion DSML or less than 0 zillion DSML.
• Galaxies with low existence expectancy index below 0.7 should be allocated at least 10% of
thetotal energy available in the foreseeable future
